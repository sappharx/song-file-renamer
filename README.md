# song-file-renamer

Run `npm i -g .` from the project root to get access to the `renamer` command

Running `renamer` will rename all files that look like `## - band name - song title.(flac|ogg|wav)` to `## - song title.(flac|ogg|wav)`

I would like to make this more generic in the future, so you can just BYO transformer function

Also, it would be cool to actually handle command-line options (see options.js)
